# Truth Seeker

A research agent specifically designed to identify and categorize voices in a research topic and build arguments for each voice, then "debate" for the truth.

## Steps

1. Initial research: Find voices
2. Breakout 2-5 different voices in the research space, then construct a prompt to specifically research each, assuming it's the truth, finding evidence for it and any argument against it.
3. Synthesize a report that covers:

   - a summary of each voice's point of view.
   - The largest factors in the decision process
   - The likeliest answer to the original query (in however long this needs to be)
   - Second-likliest answer, and why it might be right instead.
4. List all sources.
